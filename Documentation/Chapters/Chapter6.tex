\section{Future Work}
There are several shortcomings to the present version of the project. Following are the enhancements that can be worked upon:

\begin{itemize}
\item Newer heuristics similar to shortest distance can be devised to further help develop better integration tests.
\item Automatic heuristic development can be thought of on the basis of interactions within the AUT.
\item Threshold for a particular AUT varies on the basis of the spread of the Run Sequences. Ways can be devised to intelligently approximate the values to be tested.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

In Conclusion MINUSA helps ASSIST in mining useful sequences and pruning less useful sequences from a very big corpus generated. Although the task is resource and time intensive, efficient heuristics can be applied and the aim can be achieved in an acceptable time frame. Results of an application dealing in nanoscience are shown in the Appendix\ref{AppendixA} along with the code files.
